# TEXT-ANALYTICS
## Text Mining Introduction
Text Mining – In today’s context text is the most common means through which information is exchanged. But understanding the meaning from the text is not an easy job at all.

## What is Text Mining
Text Mining is also known as Text Analytics. It is the process of understanding information from a set of texts. Text Mining is designed to help the business find out valuable knowledge from text based content. These contents can be in the form of word document, email or postings on social media.
Text Mining is the use of automated methods for understanding the knowledge available in the text documents.
Text Mining can also be used to make the computer understand structured or unstructured data. Qualitative data or unstructured data are data that cannot be measured in terms of numbers. These data usually contain information like colour, texture and text. Quantitative data or structured data are data that can be measured easily. ##Unstructured data, especially text, images and videos contain a wealth of information

## How does Text Mining works 
  Text Mining system makes an exchange of words from unstructured data into numerical values. Text mining helps to identify patterns and relationships that exists within a large amount of text. Text mining often uses computational algorithms to read and analyze textual information. Without text mining it will be difficult to understand the text easily and quickly. Text can be mined in a more systematic and comprehensive way and the information about the business can be captured automatically. 
  

## NLP (NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is all about leveraging tools, techniques and algorithms to process and understand natural language-based data, which is usually unstructured like text, speech and so on. In this series of articles, we will be looking at tried and tested strategies, techniques and workflows which can be leveraged by practitioners and data scientists to extract useful insights from text data. We will also cover some useful and interesting use-cases for NLP. This article will be all about processing and understanding text data with tutorials and hands-on examples.

## Outline Of the project

1. Data Retrieval with Web Scraping
2. Text wrangling and pre-processing
3. Parts of Speech Tagging
4. Shallow Parsing
5. Constituency and Dependency Parsing
6. Named Entity Recognition
7. Emotion and Sentiment Analysis

## Text Mining includes the following list of elements

1. Text Categorization
2. Text Clustering
3. Concept/entity extraction
4. Granular taxonomies
5. Sentiment Analysis
6. Document Summarization
7. Entity Relation Modelling


## Uses of Text Mining
The names of different entities and relationships between the text can be easily found using various techniques.
It helps to extract patterns from large amount of unstructured data
Systematic reviewing of literature – It can go for in depth research of text, find out key themes and highlight the repeated terms or text and the popular topics over a period of time.
Testing of Hypothesis – Through text mining a particular hypothesis can be tested to see whether the document confirm or deny the hypothesis. Mostly an established belief is tested over the document first.

## Importance of Text Mining
Text Mining is enables better and smart decision making
It helps to solve knowledge discovery problems in different areas of business
Through text mining you can easily visualize the data in many ways like html tables, charts, graphs and others
It is a great productivity tool. It gives better results faster than any other tool.
Text mining tool is used by both large and small scale organizations who are knowledge driven organizations

## Applications of Text Mining
 1. Open ended survey questions will help the respondents to give their view or opinion without any constraints. This will help to know more about the customers’ opinions than relying on structured questionnaires. Text mining can be used to analyze such information in the form of text
  
  2.Text Mining is also mainly used to classify the text. Text Mining can be used to filter the unnecessary mail using certain words or phrases. Such mails will automatically discard such mails to spam. Such automatic system of classifying and filtering selected mails and sending it the corresponding department is done using Text Mining system. Text Mining will also send an alert to the email user to remove the mails with such offending words or content.
  
  3. In most of the business organizations information is collected mainly in the form of text. For example in a hospital the patient interviews can be narrated briefly in text form and the reports are also in the form of text. These notes are now a day’s collected electronically so that it can be easily transferred into text mining algorithms. These records can then be used to diagnose the actual situation.
   
   4. Another important application area of Text Mining is processing the contents of web pages in a particular domain. Through this way the text mining system will automatically find a list of terms which is used in the site. Through this way one can find out the most important terms used in the website. By this way one can know the capabilities about the competitors which can help you to deliver business efficiently.

## Challenges of Text Mining
The main challenge faced by Text Mining system is the natural language. The natural language faces the problem of ambiguity. Ambiguity means one term having several meanings, one phrase being interpreted in various ways and as a result different meanings are obtained.

Another limitation is that while using Information Extraction system it involves semantic analysis. Due to this the full text is not presented, only a limited part of the text is presented to the users. But these days there is a need for more text understanding.
